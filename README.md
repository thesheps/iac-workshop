# IaC Workshop
WELCOME, intrepid travellers. This workshop was hastily thrown-together to demonstrate and compare different Infrastructure as code tools!

**NOTE**: This workshop is super opinionated. It's tailored specifically towards `AWS`, and has only been tested on `Mac OSX Silicon`, using `zsh` as the shell.

To get started, check out this repo and run the `install.sh` script. This will install all the dependencies that you'll need to use the examples üöÄ

---

Each of the below examples will deploy the **AUTO-KITTENATOR** website in the `./app` folder to a static `S3 Bucket` üêà‚Äç‚¨õ

[Example 1 - CLI](./1-cli/README.md)

[Example 2 - Cloudformation](./2-cfn/README.md)

[Example 3 - AWS CDK](./3-cdk/README.md)

[Example 4 - Pulumi](./4-pulumi/README.md)

[Example 5 - Terraform](./5-terraform/README.md)
